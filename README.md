# Search Engine & Information Retrieval – Learning Repository

## What this repository is about
This repository is a learning workspace where I practice and understand
basic concepts related to search engines and information retrieval.

It is not a full search engine, but a collection of small experiments
and notes to understand how search systems work internally.

## Why I created this
Search engines are used everywhere, but their basic ideas are not always clear.
I created this repository to learn step by step how data is searched,
ranked, and retrieved from a collection of documents.

## My learnings here
- How text data is processed
- How documents and queries are represented
- Basic idea of indexing
- Simple ranking logic
- Core concepts of information retrieval

## Current status
This is an ongoing learning repository.
I add content as I learn new concepts and try small implementations.

## Tech used
- Python
- Basic data structures
- Simple text processing logic

## What I learned so far
- Difference between searching data and retrieving information
- Importance of clean data representation
- How ranking affects search results

## Future learning goals
- Implement a simple text search
- Understand basic ranking techniques
- Improve document matching logic
